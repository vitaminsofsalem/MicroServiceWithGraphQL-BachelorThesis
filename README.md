# Microservices With GraphQL Using Schema Stitching(bachelor Thesis)

## Initial Approach (1)
First, I'll start with creating a simple monolith using a schema first approach where I'll have a query/mutation of a product. The mutation can then either be stored in memory (object) or saved in a database such as Mongodb.

Next step, will be to break down this monolith into various subgraphs/microservics that we can then link to a gateway/supergraph using Schema Stitching technique.

## Week (2)
This week the task is to do more research about "Schema Stitching" and create a techincal presentation for next week.
- What is schema stitching? 
- Why is it used? 
- What problems does it solve? 
- How does it compare to Apollo Federation? 

These are just some of the questions that come to mind currently that will be answered throughout the week. I should also creata a small working prototype (possibly an extension of this current application) to use schema stitching techniques.
